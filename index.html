      <h1>Narcissistic Randomness</h1>
      <p>
        Suppose you are in a group of people, and you all want to choose
        something at random. However, no one in the group trusts anyone
        else--each member only trusts themselves. How can you generate
        a random number everyone trusts?
      </p>
      <h2>Conceptual Explanation</h2>
      <p>
        In the physical world, there are many solutions to this problem.
        The group could roll dice, flip coins, or draw slips of paper
        from a hat. These solutions all reuire that everyone in the
        group trust that some process (e.g. flipping a coin) is random
        regardless of who executes it. It turns out that with some
        clever cryptography, we can avoid making that assumption in the
        digital world! Let's see how.
      </p>
      <h3>A Non-Example</h3>
      <p>
        First, let's consider an example of what doesn't work. Let's
        suppose that Alice and Bob are roommates. One of them has to
        make dinner, but neither of them want to. To be fair, they
        decide to choose who makes dinner at random:
      </p>

      <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Alice</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Let's flip a coin. I flip; you guess. Loser makes dinner.
          Agreed?
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Bob</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Sounds good. Go ahead and flip.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Alice</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Okay. I'm flipping, ... and it's heads.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Bob</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Yes! I called heads! Looks like you're making dinner
          tonight.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Alice</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Wait a minute; that doesn't work. How do I know you actually
          called heads?
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        So that doesn't work. Let's try again, only this time the caller
        has to call the toss before they know the outcome.
      </p>

      <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Alice</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Okay, let's try again. This time, you have to call the toss
          before I tell you the outcome.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Bob</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Okay fine. I call tails.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Alice</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Okay. I'm flipping, ... and it's heads. Looks like you're
          making dinner!
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Bob</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Hold up. You're just saying it came up heads so that I lose!
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        Whoever goes last has the power to control the group's choice,
        which is not acceptable in a group of paranoid people. We just
        considered a simple example here, but think about how the same
        problem would exist for other schemes.
      </p>

      <h3>Solution: Commitment Schemes</h3>

      <p>
        Here's one solution to this problem of who goes first: have all
        group members commit to their secret before revealing it. In the
        coin flip example above, the secrets are Bob's call and the
        outcome of Alice's flip. Here's how this might work:
      </p>

      <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Alice</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Okay, I have a solution. Here's the SHA-256 hash of my call:
          <code>853ad5687e2c182baeee91d09ec990754b45516f242ffc39d34a51808b93942d</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Bob</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Hmm okay, this seems interesting. Let's try it! I'm flipping,
          ... and it's heads.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Alice</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          I called heads! You can verify like this in your terminal:
          <code>
            echo "I call heads. Why didn't we just get a meal plan?"
            | shasum -a 256
          </code>
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-1">Bob</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-11">
          Fine, I'll make dinner. But you'd better not complain about my
          cooking!
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        Here' Alice committed to her choice by reporting the SHA-256
        hash of her call. After Bob reports the outcome of the toss, he
        can verify that Alice really did call heads before the toss by
        hashing her statement. Importantly though, since SHA-256 hasn't
        been broken yet, Bob cannot determine Alice's guess from her
        hash. The hash is a commitment, but it doesn't reveal the
        secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might be wondering what the bit about meal plans is all
        about. That's just a bit of randomness to stop Bob from hashing
        <code>I call heads.</code> and comparing with the hash Alice
        provided.
      </p>
      <h3>Keybase's Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> uses commitment schemes
        to let groups of people securely make random choices without
        trusting anyone else in the group. In fact, this guide and the
        explanation above were based on a
        <a href="https://keybase.io/blog/cryptographic-coin-flipping">
          Keybase blog post
        </a>
        from 2019. Their algorithm works like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Each participant generates a random 32-byte secret.</li>
        <li>Everyone commits to their secret by publishing the SHA-256
          hash of their secret.</li>
        <li>Everyone reveals their secrets to the group and checks that
          everyone else's secrets match their commitments.</li>
        <li>Every participant XORs all the secrets together to generate
          a shared random seed.</li>
        <li>Now, everyone can form the same pseudorandom bit sequence
          seeded with this shared random seed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We will follow a similar approach, except instead of using the
        random seed to create a pseudorandom sequence, we'll just use
        the seed itself. This means that we only have 32 bytes of
        random bits to work with, but that's plenty for most choices.
      </p>
      <h2>Narcissistic Randomness in Practice</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a simple web app that implements what I'm calling
        Narcissistic Randomness. All the computations occur in your
        browser with JavaScript. I encourage you to look at the source
        of this page to see how the calculations work.
      </p>
      <h3>Generate Secret</h3>
      <p>
        The first step is to generate a 32-byte secret. You can click
        the <code>Generate</code> button to make one or provide your
        own. Secrets must be base64 encoded.
      </p>
      <form>
        <div class="row mb-3">
            <label for="secret" class="col-md-4 col-form-label">Secret:</label>
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <input type="text" id="secret" name="secret" class="form-control">
          </div>
        </div>
        <button type="button" onClick="generateSecret()"
          class="btn btn-primary">Generate</button>
      </form>
      <script>
        function generateSecret() {
          let secretElem = document.getElementById('secret');
          secretElem.value = sjcl.codec.base64.fromBits(sjcl.random.randomWords(8));
        };
      </script>
      <h3>Generate Commitment Hash</h3>
      <p>
        Next, we need to generate a hash of the secret. This will serve
        as our commitment to the secret we generated above. Click
        <code>Generate Commitment</code> and send the commitment to the
        rest of the group.
      </p>
      <form>
        <div class="row mb-3">
          <label for="commitment" class="col-md-4 col-form-label">
            Commitment Hash:
          </label>
          <div class="col-md-8">
            <input type="text" id="commitment" name="commitment"
              class="form-control">
          </div>
        </div>
        <button type="button" onClick="generateCommitment()"
          class="btn btn-primary">
          Generate Commitment
        </button>
      </form>
      <script>
        function generateCommitment() {
          let secret = document.getElementById('secret').value;
          let hash = sjcl.codec.base64.fromBits(
            sjcl.hash.sha256.hash(secret));
          let commitmentElem = document.getElementById('commitment');
          commitmentElem.value = hash;
        };
      </script>
      <h3>Collect Commitments and Secrets</h3>
      <p>
        Now, it's time to collect everyone's commitments and secrets.
        First, copy and paste everyone else's commitments below, one
        commitment per line. Once everyone has done that, you can all
        share your secrets. Collect these too and paste them below, one
        secret per line. Make sure the commitments and secrets are in
        the same order! You can verify that everyone's secret matches
        their commitment by clicking <code>Verify Commitments</code>
        below. The result is a list of booleans showing the validity of
        each commitment-secret pair, in the same order you listed them
        in the text boxes.
      </p>
      <form>
        <div class="row mb-3">
          <div class="col-lg">

      <script>
        function verifyCommitments() {
          let commitments = document.getElementById(
            'commitments').value.split('\n');
          let secrets = document.getElementById('secrets').value.split('\n');
          let validities = [];
          for (i = 0; i < commitments.length; i++) {
            let commitment = commitments[i];
            let secret = secrets[i];
            let hash = sjcl.codec.base64.fromBits(
              sjcl.hash.sha256.hash(secret));

          let result = validities.join(', ');
          document.getElementById('validities').value = result;
        };
      </script>
      <h3>Generate Random Seed from Secrets</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we have everyone's secrets and have confirmed their
        commitments, we can create the random seed. This is a simple
        bitwise XOR-ing of all the secrets. Click
        <code>Generate Seed</code>.
      </p>
      <form>
        <div class="row mb-3">

          let hexB = sjcl.codec.hex.fromBits(

          for (let i = 0; i < hexA.length; i++ ) {
            let charA = hexA[i];
            let charB = hexB[i];
            let xor = parseInt(charA, 16) ^ parseInt(charB, 16);
            hexArr.push(xor.toString(16))
          }

      <h3>Generate a Random Integer</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we have a shared random seed, we can choose a random
        number. Pick a minimum and maximum value below, and generate
        your number!
      </p>
      <p>
        To pick a random number, we first determine how many random bits
        we need to to make a random choice between the specified minimum
        and maximum values. Then, we take just enough digits from the
        hex-encoded seed to get that many bits. We drop excess bits and
        evaluate the remaining bits as a number. If the number is at
        most <code>min - max</code>, we add it to <code>min</code> to
        get our final answer. Otherwise, we move on to the next set of
        digits in the seed.
